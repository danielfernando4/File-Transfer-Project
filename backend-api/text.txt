A text file is a computer file that stores data as a sequence of lines of electronic text, often identified by the extension ".txt" and can be opened and edited using plain text editors like Notepad or TextEdit.

A text file is a simple type of computer file that stores data in a textual format, meaning it contains characters that can be read and interpreted as text. 
Common Extensions:
While the ".txt" extension is the most common, other extensions like ".log", ".csv", ".html", or ".xml" can also indicate text files, depending on the type of data they contain. 
Content:
Text files typically contain plain text without any special formatting or styling, such as bold, italics, or different fonts. 
Purpose:
Text files are used for storing and sharing textual data, configuration files, scripts, and other types of data that can be represented as text. 
Opening and Editing:
Text files can be opened and edited using various plain text editors, including Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), and other command-line text editors like Vim or Emacs. 
Example:
A simple text file might contain a list of words, a script for a program, or even a log file recording events. 
Storage Efficiency:
Text files are generally more storage-efficient than other document types like Microsoft Word documents because they store only the text data, without any formatting information.
